      "Advanced Assessment and Clinical Reasoning for the Massage Therapist",
    description: `This comprehensive course equips massage therapists with the essential skills to conduct effective clinical assessments enhancing their ability to identify musculoskeletal imbalances, dysfunctions, and movement restrictions. Through hands-on practice and evidence-based techniques, participants will learn how to perform postural analysis, range of motion testing, myotome and dermatome tesing, orthopedic assessments, and palpation strategies to tailor treatment plans for optimal client outcomes. This course emphasizes clinical reasoning, critical thinking, and professional documentation, ensuring therapists can confidently assess and address client needs within their scope of practice. It is ideal for both new and experienced therapists looking to refine their assessment skills and improve therapeutic effectiveness.`,

    title: "Orthopedic Procedures and Post-Surgical Precautions",
    subtitle: "A Clinical Approach to Safe and Effective Post-Surgical Care",
    description: `In 2014, more than one million total hip and knee replacements were performed in the United States. According to the American Joint Replacement Registry, that number is projected to rise to over four million by the year 2030. These statistics do not include total shoulder replacements, reverse total shoulder replacements, or rotator cuff repair surgeries—further emphasizing the growing population of patients recovering from major orthopedic procedures.

Despite this increase, there remains a significant educational gap between massage therapists and other healthcare professionals such as physical therapist assistants (PTAs), physical therapists (PTs), nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Many
massage therapists have limited understanding of common orthopedic pathologies of the hip and shoulder, the surgical procedures used to address them, and the post-surgical precautions and safeguards required by surgeons.

This course is designed to bridge that gap. Participants will gain a clear understanding of hip and shoulder orthopedic conditions, the related surgical interventions, and the associated post-operative precautions. The goal is to equip massage therapists with the knowledge necessary to safely and effectively support patients during recovery—enhancing therapeutic outcomes while preventing harm to surgical sites or healing tissues.

While not a hands-on technique course, this class provides a thorough review of relevant anatomy and arthrokinematics. Students will learn to properly perform goniometric measurements, accurately identify anatomical landmarks, and interpret joint range of motion (ROM) findings. The course also covers normal and abnormal end feels during ROM assessment and their clinical significance in identifying possible tissue restrictions or damage.

In addition, students will explore the fundamentals of manual muscle testing (MMT), including correct testing procedures, grading scales, and interpretation of results. By integrating this knowledge, participants will be able to evaluate patient status, recognize potential contraindications, and communicate effectively with physicians and physical therapists—using shared clinical language and understanding.`,

    description: `
Border Collies are widely considered the most intelligent dog breed, capable of mastering complex commands and intricate tasks with ease. They were developed for herding sheep along the borderlands between Scotland and England, where quick thinking and precision were essential.

These dogs have seemingly endless energy and a laser-like focus when given a job. They excel in agility trials, obedience competitions, and any activity that challenges their mind. Without sufficient stimulation, however, they can grow restless or destructive.

A Border Collie thrives with an owner who appreciates structure, discipline, and play. Their deep connection to their handlers creates a partnership that is truly remarkable—one built on trust, communication, and mutual respect.

Compact and full of personality, the French Bulldog has become the city dweller’s best friend. With their signature bat ears and expressive eyes, they have an irresistible charm that wins over anyone they meet.

Despite their small stature, Frenchies are sturdy and confident. They love short bursts of play followed by long naps on the couch. Their affectionate nature makes them ideal for apartment living or homes with limited space.

Because of their brachycephalic (short-nosed) features, they don’t tolerate excessive heat or strenuous exercise. Instead, they thrive on human companionship, moderate activity, and plenty of love and attention.
